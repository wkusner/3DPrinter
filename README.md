# 3DPrinter

This contains .stl files created in Mathematica for the purposes of 3D-printing using a method demonstrated by George Hart at the 2014 PCMI.  Various notebooks are also included.


As of January 10, 2015, the file twistnshout2.stl is maybe the cleanest build of screw-type or helicoid based trisection of a cube so far in the folder, created for a reddit/r/math thread, based on Hart's Puzzles.

The files HRT.stl and KUS*.stl are Dirichlet cell trisections created at the 2014 PCMI.
